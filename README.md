Hi there! :wave:

&nbsp;

My name is Oscar, and I dabble a bit in Open Source. Some of my roles:

* Author of [Jetbrains plugin for Avro Schema Support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15728-apache-avro-schema-support)
* PMC of [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) ([also on GitHub](https://github.com/apache/avro/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aopwvhk))
* And [a few other things](https://github.com/opwvhk?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=java&sort=)

You may also know me from my talk [It's not the size of your data, it's how you use it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4YQTDVsydU), at the 2019 bol.com IT conference
